## Introduction
### What is MERN?
&emsp;**MERN** is an acronym that stands for *MongoDB*, *Express.js*, *React*, and *Node.js*.
<br>&emsp;It represents a stack of technologies used to develop modern web applications.
<br>&emsp;Each component of the MERN stack has a specific role:
| Component     | Role |
| ------------- |  --- |
| MongoDB       |  A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents                                                                   |
| Express.js    |  A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs                                             |
| React.js      |  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, where we can create components that maintain state and manage updates efficiently |
| Node.js       |  A runtime environment that allows us to execute JavaScript on the server side, enabling the building of scalable network applications|
### Why choose MERN?
- Utilizes only a single language, JavaScript
- It is ideally suited for web applications that have a large amount of interactivity built into the front-end
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) representation is used everywhere: 
  - It is used in the Database, the Server, the client and on the wire
  - No ORM (Object Relational Mapping) required which:
    - Saves time in transformation 
    - Requires no special serialization and de-serialization code

## Coding Adventure
### Good Practices
&emsp;As a developer, it is expected to maintain some common good practices that are accepted by the majority of the developer's community. These include:
- #### Adhering to a selected naming convention
    - Regularities in variable and functions notations:
      - Identifiers for constants are denoted with all uppercase letters
    - Regularities in file naming
- #### Directory Structures
    - Easy-to-navigate file structure
    - Include only necessary files and folders
### Personal Tutorials

| [Development Environment Configuration](#development-environment-configuration)         |
| [Hello World](./Projects/01%20Hello%20World/)                                           |
| [Resume Portfolioüìú](./Projects/Complete%20Projects/01%20Resume%20Portfolio//)                       |

#### Development Environment Configuration
*`Ensure you have an internet connection to download the packages`*
- ##### Installing NVM
  - Abbreviation for *Node Version Manager*, it is version manager for Node.js (Node)
  - Download and install nvm from [github](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
  - Restart VS Code for the installation to take immediate effect in VS Code
  - Verify the proper installation of nvm by entering the following terminal command:
  ```bash
  npm --version
  ```
- ##### Installing Node
    - For the latest node version enter the following terminal command:
    ```bash
    nvm install node
    ```
    - or, for a specific node version, enter the following terminal command:
    ```bash
    nvm install <version_number>
    ```
    - Get the node version:
    ```bash
    node --version
    ``` 
    - Configure nvm to use the defined version by entering the terminal command:
    ```bash
    nvm use <version_number>
    ```
    - Verify the proper installation of node by entering the following command in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```

#### About vite
  - For this repository, we'll be using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our bundler or module handler
  - It allows developers a mechanism for authoring JavaScript in a modularized fashion (i.e., bundling)
  - It enables us to bundle our `jsx` files together since browsers doesn't understand these files
  - [More on vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
  - Addressing vite's requirements and conventions:
    - Vite requires `Node.js` version 18+ or 20+
    - [index.html placement](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root): The `index.html` is not tucked away in the `public\` folder, but resides in the project's root directory
- ##### Installation of bundler `vite`
  - Installation Procedure:
    - Install create-vite:
      ```bash
      npm install create-vite
      ```
    - Verify the installation:
      - Terminal Command:
        ```bash
        npm ls
        ```
      - Expected Output: `create-vite@` with version number specified at the end
